This file provides guidance for manual network setup on the Android target
device to enable L2TP/PPP VPN functionality after xl2tpd and pppd are running.
These commands typically require root access on the Android device.

*******************************************************************************
*** IMPORTANT: These are GENERAL guidelines. You MUST adapt interface names ***
*** (e.g., wlan0, rmnet_data0, ppp0) and IP ranges to your specific device  ***
*** and network configuration.                                              ***

⚙️ 5. Enable IP Forwarding and Setup NAT (Network Address Translation) on TARGET DEVICE

These steps are performed ON THE ANDROID DEVICE, usually via 'adb shell' with root privileges.

A. Enable IP Forwarding:
   This allows the Android device to route packets between different network interfaces
   (e.g., between the VPN's PPP interface and the device's internet connection).

   Run as root on the Android device:
   echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

   To make it persistent across reboots (Android specific, might require init scripts or magisk module):
   This is often reset on boot. For permanent changes, you'd typically need to modify
   boot scripts, which is advanced and device-dependent. For testing, setting it
   manually after each boot is common.

B. Setup NAT using iptables:
   NAT allows clients connected to your VPN (on the PPP interface) to share the
   Android device's internet connection (e.g., wlan0 for Wi-Fi, rmnet_data0 for mobile data).

   First, identify your interfaces:
   *   Internet Interface: The interface your Android device uses to connect to the internet.
       Common names: wlan0, wlan1 (Wi-Fi), rmnet_data0, rmnet_data1 (Mobile Data), eth0 (Ethernet).
       You can check with: ip addr show  OR  ifconfig
   *   PPP Interface: The virtual interface created when a VPN client connects.
       Common names: ppp0, ppp1, etc. This interface will only appear AFTER a client connects.
       You can check with: ip addr show  OR  ifconfig (after client connection)

   Let's assume:
   - Your Internet Interface is: wlan0 (CHANGE THIS IF DIFFERENT)
   - Your PPP Interface (once a client connects) will be: ppp0 (CHANGE THIS IF DIFFERENT)
   - Your VPN client IP pool (from xl2tpd.conf 'ip range') is: 192.168.177.10-192.168.177.100

   Run these iptables commands as root on the Android device:

   # 1. Flush existing NAT rules (Optional, use with caution if other NAT is set up)
   #    If unsure, skip this or back up rules first: iptables-save > /data/local/tmp/iptables_backup.txt
   # iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING

   # 2. Add the MASQUERADE rule for your VPN traffic
   #    This rule tells the kernel to rewrite the source IP address of packets
   #    from your VPN clients to be the IP address of your Android device's
   #    internet interface, so they appear to originate from the Android device itself.
   iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.177.10-192.168.177.100 -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
   # Replace 'wlan0' with your actual internet-facing interface.
   # Replace '192.168.177.10-192.168.177.100' if you are using a more specific subnet like 192.168.177.0/24

   # 3. Add FORWARDING rules to allow traffic between interfaces.
   #    These rules explicitly permit packets to be forwarded.

   #    Allow established and related connections from internet to VPN clients
   iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o ppp0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

   #    Allow traffic from VPN clients to the internet interface
   iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o wlan0 -j ACCEPT

   #    (Optional, more restrictive) Allow traffic from VPN clients only to the internet, not other local networks on Android
   #    iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o wlan0 -s 192.168.177.10-192.168.177.100 -d 0/0 -j ACCEPT


   #    Drop other forwarded traffic (if you want a default deny policy for forwarding)
   #    Be careful with this, it might break other things if not configured correctly.
   #    iptables -P FORWARD DROP  (Then you need to explicitly ACCEPT everything you need)
   #    A more common approach is to have a default ACCEPT FORWARD policy and just add the specific rules above.
   #    Check current policy: iptables -L FORWARD -v

   # To make iptables rules persistent across reboots on Android:
   # This is challenging. Standard Linux methods like 'iptables-persistent' are not usually available.
   # Solutions often involve:
   #   - Running a script at boot (e.g., via an 'init.d' equivalent if your ROM supports it, or a Magisk module).
   #   - Some VPN client apps that manage server configurations might re-apply rules.
   #   - For development/testing, manually re-applying after each boot is common.

C. Verify:
   - After a VPN client connects, check 'ifconfig' or 'ip addr' on the Android device to see the pppX interface.
   - Ping from the VPN client to an internet address (e.g., 8.8.8.8).
   - Try to browse the web from the VPN client.

Troubleshooting on Target:
- If no internet:
    - Check ip_forward: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward (should be 1)
    - Check iptables rules: iptables -t nat -L -v  AND  iptables -L FORWARD -v
    - Check DNS on client: Is it receiving the DNS servers specified in options.xl2tpd?
    - Check logs from pppd (if enabled in options.xl2tpd) and xl2tpd (if debug enabled).
    - Can the Android device itself access the internet on the 'wlan0' (or equivalent) interface?
- Make sure SELinux is not blocking pppd or xl2tpd operations if you see permission errors.
  (e.g., setenforce 0 for testing, but this is a security risk).
