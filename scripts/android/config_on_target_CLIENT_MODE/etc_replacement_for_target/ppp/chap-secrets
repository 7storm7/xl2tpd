# Secrets for CHAP and MS-CHAP authentication for pppd (Client Mode)
# Used when this Android device connects as a client to a remote L2TP server.
#
# Format:
# <our_username_for_server> <server_name_or_*> <our_password_for_server> <our_local_IP_or_*>
#
# The 'our_username_for_server' MUST match the 'user "yourVpnUsername"' option in the
# corresponding PPP options file (e.g., options.myvpn).
#
# The 'server_name_or_*' can be:
#   '*' : to match any server name presented by the remote LNS.
#   A specific server name: if the remote LNS presents a specific "name" during LCP negotiation
#                          and you want to tie these credentials to that specific server name.
#                          (e.g., if remote server is 'RemoteLNS1')
#
# The 'our_password_for_server' is the secret password for the yourVpnUsername account on the remote LNS.
#
# The 'our_local_IP_or_*' can be:
#   '*' : to allow any local IP address to be assigned by the server. (Most common for clients)
#   A specific IP: if you want to request a specific IP from the server (server must allow this).

"yourVpnUsername"    *    "yourVpnPassword"    *
# Example if server name was specific:
# "yourVpnUsername"    "NameOfRemoteL2TPServer"    "yourVpnPassword"    *
